## Synopsis

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/wesovi/acceptance-tests-ng](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/wesovi/acceptance-tests-ng?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is a simple proof of concept that will guide us on how to do acceptance tests on a dockerized environment.
This is a maven project with 3 submodules, a couple of spring boot micro services(one micro service  inserts data into the database and the other one extract it) and the third submodule will show us how we can run our cucumber acceptance tests against a a dockerized environment.

Each micro service also includes a few integration tests developed with RestAssured (these tests will run in a local environment and using standalone server.)

## Code Example
Below a cucumber scenario
	
	Scenario: Getting the list of items when the database is empty
		Given a database with no items 
		When we ask for the list of items
		Then we obtain no items

## Motivation

Being focused on the best way to do acceptance tests. Run acceptance tests in a local environment could be risky since we are not running our tests in a production environment. Docker allows us to do acceptance tests on a real environment since our own workstation.  

## Installation

Just clone the project and let it go!

## API Reference
TODO

## Tests
* Extraction micro service (ms.extraction):
	* **mvn verify -Pintegration** : Run integration testing.
* Insertion micro service (ms.insertion):
	* **mvn verify -Pintegration** : Run integration testing.
* Acceptance tests (ms.at):
	* **mvn verify**: Run acceptance tests on a dockerized environment.
